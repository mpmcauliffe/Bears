        `The American black bear (Ursus americanus) is a medium-sized bear
        native to North America. It is the continent's smallest and most widely
        distributed bear species. American black bears are omnivores, with their diets
        varying greatly depending on season and location. They typically live in
        largely forested areas but will leave forests in search of food. They are
        sometimes attracted to human communities because of the immediate availability
        of food. The American black bear is the world's most common bear species. The
        fur, though usually black, is not always this color. Some subspecies do not
        show as black.`, 
        `It is listed by the International Union for Conservation of
        Nature (IUCN) as a least-concern species, due to its widespread distribution
        and a large population estimated to be twice that of all other bear species
        combined. Along with the brown bear, it is one of only two of the eight modern
        bear species not considered by the IUCN to be globally threatened with
        extinction.`

    'brown': [
        `The brown bear (Ursus arctos) is a large bear species found across
        Eurasia and North America. In North America, the populations of
        brown bears are called grizzly bears. It is one of the largest living
        terrestrial members of the order Carnivora, rivaled in size only by its
        closest relative, the polar bear (Ursus maritimus), which is much less
        variable in size and slightly bigger on average. The
        brown bear's range includes parts of Russia, Central Asia, China,
        Canada, the United States, Hokkaido, Scandinavia, the Balkans, the
        Picos de Europa and the Carpathian region, especially Romania,
        Bulgaria, Iran, Anatolia and the Caucasus. The brown bear is
        recognized as a national and state animal in several European
        countries.`,
        `While the brown bear's range has shrunk and it has faced local
        extinctions, it remains listed as a least concern species by the
        International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) with a total
        estimated population in 2017 of 110,000. As of 2012, this and the
        American black bear are the only bear species not classified as
        threatened by the IUCN. Populations that were hunted to
        extinction in the 19th and 20th centuries are the Atlas bear of North
        Africa and the Californian, Ungavan and Mexican populations of
        the grizzly bear of North America. Many of the populations in the
        southern parts of Eurasia are highly endangered as well. One of
        the smaller-bodied forms, the Himalayan brown bear, is critically
        endangered, occupying only 2% of its former range and threatened by
        uncontrolled poaching for its body parts. The Marsican brown bear
        of central Italy is one of several currently isolated populations of
        the Eurasian brown bear and is believed to have a population of just 50
        to 60 bears.`

    'giant': [
        `The giant panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca; Chinese: 大熊猫; pinyin:
        dàxióngmāo), also known as the panda bear or simply the panda, is a
        bear native to south central China. It is characterised by large,
        black patches around its eyes, over the ears, and across its round
        body. The name "giant panda" is sometimes used to distinguish it from
        the red panda, a neighboring musteloid. Though it belongs to the order
        Carnivora, the giant panda is a folivore, with bamboo shoots and leaves
        making up more than 99% of its diet. Giant pandas in the wild will
        occasionally eat other grasses, wild tubers, or even meat in the form
        of birds, rodents, or carrion. In captivity, they may receive honey,
        eggs, fish, yams, shrub leaves, oranges, or bananas along with
        specially prepared food.`,
        `The giant panda lives in a few mountain ranges in central China,
        mainly in Sichuan, but also in neighbouring Shaanxi and Gansu. As a
        result of farming, deforestation, and other development, the giant
        panda has been driven out of the lowland areas where it once lived, and
        it is a conservation-reliant vulnerable species. A 2007 report
        showed 239 pandas living in captivity inside China and another 27
        outside the country. As of December 2014, 49 giant pandas lived in
        captivity outside China, living in 18 zoos in 13 different
        countries. Wild population estimates vary; one estimate shows that
        there are about 1,590 individuals living in the wild, while a 2006
        study via DNA analysis estimated that this figure could be as high as
        2,000 to 3,000. Some reports also show that the number of giant
        pandas in the wild is on the rise. In March 2015, conservation news
        site Mongabay stated that the wild giant panda population had increased
        by 268, or 16.8%, to 1,864. In 2016, the IUCN reclassified the
        species from "endangered" to "vulnerable", affirming decade-long
        efforts to save the panda.`,
        `While the dragon has often served as China's national symbol,
        internationally the giant panda has often filled this role. As such, it
        is becoming widely used within China in international contexts, for
        example, appearing since 1982 on gold panda bullion coins and as one of
        the five Fuwa mascots of the Beijing Olympics.`

    'moon': [
        `The Asian black bear (Ursus thibetanus, previously known as
        Selenarctos thibetanus), also known as the Asiatic black bear, moon
        bear and white-chested bear, is a medium-sized bear species native to
        Asia that is largely adapted to an arboreal lifestyle. It lives
        in the Himalayas, in the northern parts of the Indian subcontinent, the
        Korean Peninsula, northeastern China, the Russian Far East, the Honshū
        and Shikoku islands of Japan, and Taiwan. It is classified as
        vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation of Nature
        (IUCN), mostly because of deforestation and hunting for its body
        parts. Although largely herbivorous, Asian black bears can be very
        aggressive toward humans, who frequently trap or kill them for
        traditional medicine.`
    ],
    
    'polar': [
        `The polar bear (Ursus maritimus) is a hypercarnivorous bear whose
        native range lies largely within the Arctic Circle, encompassing the
        Arctic Ocean, its surrounding seas and surrounding land masses. It is
        the largest extant bear species, as well as the largest extant
        predatory carnivore.[5][6] A boar (adult male) weighs around 350–700 kg
        (772–1,543 lb),[7] while a sow (adult female) is about half that size.
        Although it is the sister species of the brown bear,[8] it has evolved
        to occupy a narrower ecological niche, with many body characteristics
        adapted for cold temperatures, for moving across snow, ice and open
        water, and for hunting seals, which make up most of its diet.[9]
        Although most polar bears are born on land, they spend most of their
        time on the sea ice. Their scientific name means "maritime bear" and
        derives from this fact. Polar bears hunt their preferred food of seals
        from the edge of sea ice, often living off fat reserves when no sea ice
        is present. Because of their dependence on the sea ice, polar bears are
        classified as marine mammals.`,
        `Because of expected habitat loss caused by climate change, the polar
        bear is classified as a vulnerable species. For decades, large-scale
        hunting raised international concern for the future of the species, but
        populations rebounded after controls and quotas began to take
        effect. For thousands of years, the polar bear has been a key
        figure in the material, spiritual, and cultural life of circumpolar
        peoples, and polar bears remain important in their cultures.
        Historically, the polar bear has also been known as the "white
        bear". It is sometimes referred to as the "nanook", based on the
        Inuit term nanuq.`

    'sloth': [
        `The sloth bear (Melursus ursinus) is a myrmecophagous bear species
        native to the Indian subcontinent. It feeds on fruits, ants and
        termites. It is listed as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List, mainly
        because of habitat loss and degradation.
        It has also been called "labiated bear" because of its long lower lip
        and palate used for sucking up insects. It has a long, shaggy fur, a
        mane around the face, and long, sickle-shaped claws. It is lankier than
        brown and Asian black bears. It shares features of insectivorous
        mammals and evolved during the Pleistocene from the ancestral brown
        bear through convergent evolution.`,
        `Sloth bears breed during spring and early summer and give birth near
        the beginning of winter. When their territories are encroached upon by
        humans, they sometimes attack them. Historically, humans have
        drastically reduced these bears' habitat and diminished their
        population by hunting them for food and products such as their bacula
        and claws. Sloth bears have been tamed and used as performing animals
        and as pets.`

    'spectacled': [
        `The spectacled bear (Tremarctos ornatus), also known as the Andean
        bear, Andean short-faced bear, or mountain bear and locally as jukumari
        (Aymara and Quechua), ukumari (Quechua) or ukuku, is the last
        remaining short-faced bear (subfamily Tremarctinae). Its closest
        relatives are the extinct Florida spectacled bear, and the giant
        short-faced bears of the Middle to Late Pleistocene age (Arctodus and
        Arctotherium). Spectacled bears are the only surviving species of
        bear native to South America, and the only surviving member of the
        subfamily Tremarctinae. The species is classified as Vulnerable by the
        IUCN because of habitat loss.`

    'sun': [
        `The sun bear (Helarctos malayanus) is a species in the family Ursidae
        occurring in the tropical forests of Southeast Asia. It is the smallest
        bear, standing nearly 70 centimetres (28 inches) at the shoulder and
        weighing 25–65 kilograms (55–143 pounds). It is stockily built, with
        large paws, strongly curved claws, small rounded ears and a short
        snout. The fur is generally jet-black, but can vary from grey to red.
        Sun bears get their name from the characteristic orange to cream
        coloured chest patch. Its unique morphology—inward-turned front feet,
        flattened chest, powerful forelimbs with large claws—suggests
        adaptations for climbing.`,
        `The most arboreal (tree-living) of all bears, the sun bear is an
        excellent climber and sunbathes or sleeps in trees 2 to 7 metres (7 to
        23 feet) above the ground. It is mainly active during the day, though
        nocturnality might be more common in areas frequented by humans. Sun
        bears tend to remain solitary but sometimes occur in pairs (such as a
        mother and her cub). They do not seem to hibernate, possibly because
        food resources are available the whole year throughout the range. Being
        omnivores, sun bears have a broad diet including ants, bees, beetles,
        honey, termites and plant material such as seeds and several kinds of
        fruits; vertebrates such as birds and deer are also eaten occasionally.
        They breed throughout the year; individuals become sexually mature at
        two to four years of age. Litters comprise one or two cubs that remain
        with their mother for around three years.`,
        `The range of the sun bear is bound by northeastern India to the north
        and extends south to southeast through Bangladesh, Cambodia, Myanmar,
        Laos, Thailand and Vietnam in mainland Asia to Brunei, Indonesia and
        Malaysia to the south. These bears are threatened by heavy
        deforestation and illegal hunting for food and the wildlife trade; they
        are also harmed in conflicts with humans when they enter farmlands,
        plantations and orchards. The global population is estimated to have
        declined by 35% over the past three decades. The IUCN has listed this
        species as vulnerable.`
